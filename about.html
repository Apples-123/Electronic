<div class="about"><p>My name is Donne Mckeet, I reside in brooklyn, Ysterplaat</p>

    <p2><br>I have attended Trafalgar High School and matriculated in 2017</p2></br>
    
    <p3><br>From high school, I went to Pearsons Institue of Higher Education 
        and completed an NQF5 in Business Management and have done 2 years in Bcom.
    </p3></br>
    
    <p4><br>In 2021 I went to CTU Traning Solutions and done an 7 week course in Python.
        Following into 2022, i did an Excel and PowerPoint course as well 
        as an NQF5 in Software Development.
    </p4></br>
    
    <p5><br>Describing myself, I would say I am a hard worker. I am willing to learn and try
        new things as well.
    </p5></br>
    
    <p6><br> I am motivated and want to thrive for better.</p6></br>
    
    <p7><br> My weakness is that I over-analyze everything and put myself under a lot of pressure to complete work.</p7></br>
    
    <p8><br>What I love doing the most in my spare time is baking and cooking.</p8></br>
